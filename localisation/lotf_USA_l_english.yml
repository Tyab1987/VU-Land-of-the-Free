#Events by Chewy
 lotf_events.1.t: "A New Nation Declared in America"
 lotf_events.1.d: "The conflict on the North American continent has ended, and the British have conceded defeat. A new independent nation has been declared by their former colonial subject, newly fashioned 'The United States of America.' What could this mean for the future of the world? That is a question that is hard to answer currently, as only time will tell." 
 lotf_events.1.a: "What a glorious morning for America!"
 lotf_events.2.t: "The United States of America is Victorious!"
 lotf_events.2.d: "The war on the North American continent has concluded, and the former colonial subjects of Great Britain have delcared their independence. This war and subsequent victory will be told for centuries to come, with the soverignty of the United States of America being enforced.\n\n§GHenceforth, English cultured provinces will now begin to shift toward American culture as the people align themselves more with their national identity rather than their former colonial one§!." 
 lotf_events.2.a: "My home sweet home!"
 lotf_events.3.t: "The Thirteen Colonies Declare Independence!"
 lotf_events.3.d: "The declaration has been looming over the horizon for many months as the colonial assembly has been meeting in secret. The decision on governance has been made, and a federal republic shall be constructed!"

 lotf_events.5.t: "The Colonies are Revolting!"
 lotf_events.5.d: "Armed protests have started popping up in multiple cities in the Thirteen Colonies in response to our justified increase in tarrifs. Our top advisors have recommended raising the army and preparing to quell these rebellions."
 lotf_events.5.a: "This is not good news.. Rally the troops!"
 lotf_events.6.t: "The Boston Tea Party"
 lotf_events.6.d: "A group of patriots gathered in Boston to protest the unjust tax placed on our populous. The British were importing tonnes of tea, of which the colonies were expected to pay an atrocious tariff on. The tea was thrown overboard and the Sons of Liberty are being heralded as heros by the townsfolk of Boston and surrounding communities."
 lotf_events.6.a: "Patriots Unite!"
 lotf_events.7.t: "Lexington and Concord"
 lotf_events.7.d: "On [GetDateText] colonial militias assembled and attacked British troops stationed in the towns of Lexington and Concord, not far from Boston. This belligerance toward the crown was not to be taken lightly, and the crown would send thousands of troops to the Thirteen Colonies to quell the rebellion."
 lotf_events.7.a: "A Declaration of Independence must be signed!"
 lotf_events.8.t: "The so Called 'Boston Tea Party'"
 lotf_events.8.d: "A group of rowdy young men refering to themselves as the 'Sons of Liberty' rushed one of his magesties ships and desecrated it, throwing the contents overboard. The shipment contained more than 92,000 pounds of tea and it's a complete loss.. Not only is this a large financial hit for our coffers, but this slight should not be taken lightly."
 lotf_events.8.a: "These rebellious criminals must be tracked down and prosecuted!"
 lotf_events.9.t: "Separatist Sentiment in South Carolina"
 lotf_events.9.d: "With the abolition of slavery at the federal level, the southern states have grown quite resentful toward the central government. Talks of seccession have been popping up, and today word reached the capital that South Carolina has declared their intent to form a proprietary government that 'better reflects the values of their state.'"
 lotf_events.9.a: "This treasonous behavior can not stand!"
 lotf_events.10.t: "Florida Announces Confederation"
 lotf_events.10.d: "Flordia has announced their intention to join the southern 'Confederation.' At this point, it's hard to say what this means but perhaps it would be in our best interests to rally the troups in case of large scale rebellion."
 lotf_events.10.a: "This treasonous behavior can not stand!"
 lotf_events.11.t: "Alabama and Georgia Join the Confederates!"
 lotf_events.11.d: "Word has reached [Root.Capital.GetName] that Alabama and Georgia have also decided to join the Confederate secession movement in the south.. A formal declaration of seccession is likely inevitable at this point."
 lotf_events.11.a: "They have no idea what they're getting themselves into.."
 lotf_events.12.t: "Virginia, Tennesse, and North Carolina Join the South!"
 lotf_events.12.d: "The southern states have combined their wills to claim a confederation of states, with secession from the federal union being their obvious intention.

 lotf_events.12.a: "God save our union.."
 lotf_events.13.t: "The Confederate States Declare Independence!"
 lotf_events.13.d: "On [GetDateText], word reached [Root.Capital.GetName] that the Confederate States in the south have signed and officially implimented documentation that states that the union of the federal government and their states are null and void, and that any attempts by the federal government to assert power in said states will be perceived as an act of war."

 lotf_events.14.t: "The Brother's War is Finally Over"
 lotf_events.14.d: "Bloody and painful civil conflict has torn our nation from top to bottom. There are very few people within the borders that are not affected directly by the strife that has plagued our nation. With peace upon us and our union restored, 'Reconstruction' must now begin, to both rebuild our damaged nation, and rebuild our damaged relations within the union. The issue on everyone's mind currently is what is the fate of the Confederate administration?"
 lotf_events.14.a: "Pardons will show we have mercy on our own."
 lotf_events.14.b: "We must make an example of them!"
 lotf_events.15.t: "The 'Abolition of Slavery Act'"
 lotf_events.15.d: "The federal government has united and passed the 'Abolition of Slavery Act,' effectively eliminating any legality to the ownership of other people under any pretext. This is a huge step forward for our liberal democracy, with many leaps to go to reach a truely equal nation. The main question moving forward is what is to be done regarding the newly freed men of color."
 lotf_events.15.a: "Is freedom not enough?"
 lotf_events.15.b: "Equal rights are the only fair path."
 lotf_events.15.c: "Federal integration! Equality and equity!"
 lotf_events.17.t: "A New Capital"

The construction of a new capital distict, separate from state soverignty, has been undertaken in Maryland and the nation shall henceforth be governed from that seat. The city shall be called Washington after our founding father, with the District of Columbia, after the great explorer. Likewise, construction has concluded for the estate to be the home of the sitting president in the new capital. The property has been dubbed 'The White House' due to the color of paint chosen to cover the sandstone structures.

 lotf_events.18.a: "What is an army without a good leader?"
 lotf_events.19.t: "The Question of Governance"
 lotf_events.19.d: "With the civil war concluded, the government is reeling and weak. Certain influential voices have been pushing for a more central government, headed by a king to reign in and rally the populous. Others have insisted that the republic must stand, and must be reinforced via various acts of Congress."
 lotf_events.19.a: "It's good to be king."
 lotf_events.19.b: "The republic must be strengthened!"
 lotf_events.22.t: "Defections in [Root.GetName]!"
 lotf_events.22.d: "[civil_war_province_to_cede.GetAreaName] has been occupied by [From.GetName] and the local populous has decided to switch their allegience to their occupiers rather than resist! This offense will not be taken lightly!"
